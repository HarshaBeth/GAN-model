# DC GAN Model - Handwritten Digit Generator

### Impact 
Generating realistic images has many useful impacts, such as creating immersive experiences in video games, creating realistic faces for animation, and much more! This project is a step forward to understand the process of  GANs. I used the MNIST dataset to train our model and with 10,000 epochs our GAN model quickly learned to generate realistic images of handwritten digits as seen below.
